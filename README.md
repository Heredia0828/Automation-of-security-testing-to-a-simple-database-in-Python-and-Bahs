What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS). Examples of DBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB. Databases are used to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently.

What are Backups For?
Backups are copies of data from a database that are taken at regular intervals and stored separately. The purpose of backups is to ensure data can be recovered in case of data loss, corruption, or disaster. Regular backups are crucial for data integrity and availability.
